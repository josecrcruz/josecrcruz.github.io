I've started my professional journey in Information Technologies back in 1999 and my roles during that journey have ranged from development of large scale CRM applications to multi pillar applications architectures to complex data management architectures. This path has provided me first hand insight and a good grasp on why data is extremely important for businesses, organisations and society. 

Data collection happens at every moment of our life, from smartwatch sensors, from mobile phone applications or from all applications we interact directly or indirectly when we purchase tickets for a theatre session, drive on a highway monitored by cameras or even when we go to the hospital to get a treatment. Data is intrinsic to our lives and if explored properly and securely it can transform society. This is what fascinates me... using technology and data to make the world a better place.

It is common sense that companies and organisations that do drive their activity leveraging data are the most successful ones. Although this is common sense it is easier said than done and due to a lack of factors related to people, process and technology, the majority of the data driven initiatives often do not deliver on their promises and technology is seldom the reason of that.

My drive and passion, from a technology perspective, is to understand the art of possible and design and deploy data architectures that combine the best of technology with information management trends and frameworks that address real life use cases that can transform businesses, organisations and society in general.

This blog main purpose is to understand, explore and ideate on 1) information management trends, frameworks and technologies, 2) how those can be put together to deliver fit for purpose architectures that 3) can realise optimal value from data by delivering information as and when needed.

Please note this blog will naturally incorporate my points of view, opinions, mistakes and beliefs that are naturally biased by the personal and work experience I've had so far and those might not be applied to your particular case or situation.

I proudly work at Oracle and because of that I'm naturally biased and influenced by my journey at Oracle. I do believe Oracle is at the forefront of IT innovation, it delivers excellent technology that can make a real and positive impact to everyone that uses it.

Please note that although I work for Oracle, the views expressed on this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Oracle.
