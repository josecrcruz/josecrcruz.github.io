# **Introduction**

Much have been said and written about Data Mesh as it is an exciting concept that is still maturing and that has generated a lot of enthusiasm with data practitioners. The term Data Mesh was first coined by Zhamak Dhegani in 2019 in the blog post [How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html), refined later on a second blog post, [Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html) and afterwards Zhamak released the [Data Mesh book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-mesh/9781492092384/), and excellent read that is recommended for any data practitioner.

Here on this post I assume you are familiar with the Data Mesh concept and theory; if not, the sources above are the golden sources to familiarise yourself with it.

The Data Mesh concept relies on the fact that previous architectural styles and approaches have failed because they leverage a centralised approach, where IT centralises technology, skills, ownership, that created a bottleneck in delivering value derived from data to consumers.

The image above depicts the different data architecture approaches that historically have been used:

1. **Data Warehouse Era** - Initially when Data Warehouses were designed the ultimate goal was to support a demand of business requirements that was perfectly met by the supply of data the company acquired and generated.
2. **Data Warehouse Era** - Reality of this era was that the match between demand and supply of data was never met as demand outpaced the supply of data and the speed of which the central IT could deliver releases and features to business users.
3. **Data Lake Era** -  Circa 2010 Data Lakes became quite popular as they promised to democratize data, taking advantage of the "data deluge" that increasingly companies were facing and allowing data consumers to take advantage of that data with increased agility compared to what they could get from the Data Warehouse. On most case Data Lakes often complemented the Data Warehouse rather than replace it.
4. **Self Service Era** - Despite the promise of the data democratisation of the Data Lake, due to the centralisation of technology, skills, ownership, that was adopted even for Data Lakes, and also due to Data Lakes being more difficult to manage and use, the majority of the Lines of Business inside the organisations turned to self service tools and technologies that promised the agility and delivery of value the business demanded. Wide adoption of self service technology was often without the IT team input and typically it created ungoverned data silos, often creating severe data quality issues. 
5. **Data Mesh Era** - We are currently on the Data Mesh era, where data practitioners look into this new concept as a way to once again, have a balance of business demand and supply of data, removing the bottlenecks of a centralised IT by decentralising technology, skills and ownership.

We got to an inflexion point where Data Mesh promises
